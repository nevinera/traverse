##Blind

Idea for middle of campaign dungeon or use before entering new terrain.  
Basis is for deep in mountain / cave where no light available.

### Story
You've escaped ________ and now find yourselves in what you believe to be the heart of the mountain, far away from the 
light of day and goblin fires.  With only certain death behind you, you press on not knowing what new dangers await you 
in the eternal night of the subterranean.

### Special Rules 
  - Visbility is 2 squares radius
  - Monsters get surprise attack when discovered then remain on board
    - Heroes turn pauses with current spending and monster turn begins.  Once monster turn complete, heroe's turn resumes
  - Hero movement points spent individually (to allow for monster reveals if necessary)
  
### Monsters
  * high knockback - potential monster chain if hero knocked back into other monster radius
  * mostly midlevel monsters = moderate HP & armor, slightly above avg magic use
  * mostly non-humanoid
  
### Traps / Obstacles
  - pits (work with knockback)
  - pillars = +1 dmg if knocked into
  
### Map
  W = pillar
  P = Pit
  M = Monster
  G = Goal / Exit
  T = Treasure (torches, potential item)
