##LAVA!!!

idea was initially for a lead-in to Blind with Trying to escape from large monster, but seemed too overdone or cliche'.
  - using smaller monsters and obstacles to slow down big baddy

The path has not been easy, but it seems that you may have finally cought a break.  As you take 
in your surroundings, you notice far fewer signs of life here.  There are no shattered objects, 
no bones strewn about...it seems almost too quiet.  You also noticed that the subterranean chill 
seems to be abating considerably.  If not for the mortal peril you seem to attract, you'd even be 
tempted to dress down a bit.  Does anyone else hear a rumbling sound?

####Emphasized concepts
    - potential deliberate knockback to advance
    - spending AP as movement
    - Escape from monsters instead of brawling
      - potential reward of additional MP 
    - potential item use for MP
      - Winged Sandals
    - Obstacle navigation


###Map
  = straight forward winding corridor w/ limited exploration
    - monster and obstacle placement will depend on developed mechanics.
