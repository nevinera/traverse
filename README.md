# Traverse

The rules and cards for a card-based deck-building dungeon-crawler.

This game is intended to be in the spirit of Descent, but using constructed decks from
card-pools gained while leveling up.

## Development Notes

Any file may have a section on the end called 'notes', 'development notes', 'working notes', etc -
these sections are not part of the game, but are places for us to keep information we need to keep
track of while developing it.

Also, any folder may have a README.md in it, which will be displayed when viewing that folder in github -
these files should describe strategy for development and notes about the intent of a directory, like a
'notes' section for a whole folder.
