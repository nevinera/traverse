## Ideas

This file is for concepts and ideas for skills that are not fleshed out, or do not fit in any existing skills.


#### Spend for bonus to hit

Either as a theme, or as a secondary ability to add to an uninteresting attack.
It could be viable as a passive too, it would make a lot of sense to tack into Archery later.



#####(from email 9/24 - will better organize at later date)
We had mentioned the possibility of gear a few times, but never really went into it.  This might complicate things more than is worth, but could add a fairly simple reward option and allow additional areas of character development.

Each character can have one item in play per 5 total ranks (Ex. 1x insight + 2x axes + 2x arcane = 5).  Unless otherwise stated, the item benefits apply only to the bearer.  Characters may possess multiple items, but they are stored in a general pool and only 1 can be active per dungeon.  

We can either have a rule that if a new item is acquired in a dungeon, they can swap out their current item at this time only for the new item, or that if they want to use a potential new item, they must have an empty item slot going into the dungeon. I'm partial to the former as it would not bias to those familiar with the dungeon.

The items could be ranked by potency (Class A, B, C pools, etc) and one could either be assigned to a dungeon or be randomly selected.

item ideas

Herculean Gauntlets = once per turn, one damaging attack may deal 1 additional damage
Gem of clarity = Once per turn, you may add a +1 bonus to either a magic attack or defense roll
Shield Bracelet = once per turn, you may add 1 die to a magic defense roll
Tiger Wraps = Once per turn, an ability may cost 1 less AP to play
Winged Shoes = Add +2 to your movement points each turn
Torch = add +2 to visibility (dungeon specific)
Etc.

We were also talking about replacing a class due to overlap with axes and power skill sets

If we were to add an alchemy or similar class, it could be a low-level catch all (minor AOE, heals, range, stat boost, etc).  If items are used, this could include an item upgrade feature as an ability, making it more rewarding later in the game as more items are accrued.

Alchemy ~ you may destroy 3 class A items to draw one random class B item
              ~ you may destroy 5 minor healing potions to create 1 medium heal
     This could be done for AP during a dungeon or between dungeons


Also had an idea for a dungeon (3rd or higher)

BLIND

The map is laid out, but heroes only have a 3 square visibility.  Movement would be done one space at a time, and the DM would put markers indicating pillars or walls as the dungeon was explored.  Monsters would not be activated until the hero brought them into visibility.  Once a monster is activated, the heroes turn is "paused" and the monster takes its turn. (~ surprise attack). Once the monsters' turn is completed the heroes turn would resume.  

Usually, one would presume the hero would try and attack the newly revealed monster at this point so as not to accumulate more.  As the heroes' turn is only paused, the monster could get another turn sooner than standard time adding a degree of difficulty for heroes.  To make things more interesting, I think there should be either some kind of rush mechanic or a lot of knock-back to allow for the potential accumulation of monsters.

The objective would be to reach a fixed tile on the map that, ideally, should be determined by the DM and fixed before the dungeon starts to keep things fresh for future play-throughs.  The location could be fixed to a certain room or left wide open (Ex. placed at the furthest point so full exploration necessary, or placed near the start to allow for potential item miss or skipping past it).

I toyed with the idea of a map reveal by having covers put over tiles, but I think it would get too cumbersome, though it would allow for the fixed exit location easier and for a couple other surprises.
