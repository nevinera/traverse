# Druidism

The themes are healing and shapeshifting - druids are naturally support
characters, but they can be used as physical Melee in a pinch or when their
healing skills are unneeded. Their healing spells are never immediate - Druid
healing requires foresight to be effective. In animal form, they are less effective
than pure Melee roles, but their ability to switch roles smoothly allows them to be
very efficient heroes.

## Rank One (30 cards)

Passive: any time a healing spell would enter your discard pile, roll a die.
On 5-6, you may put it on the bottom of your deck instead.

Active: at the beginning of your turn you may discard one card to gain 'Cat Form'
until your next turn. Playing any card will remove this form, but while in it you
gain a +1 bonus to Physcal attacks, and your basic attack costs one less AP.
