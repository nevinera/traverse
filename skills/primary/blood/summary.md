# Blood

The themes of Blood are vampirism and blood sacrifice. It is a healing
and spell damage role, intended to support a more physical, front-line
hero. The damage spells are generally shorter range and lower damage
than are the spells of the more dedicated casters, but most of those
spells heal their caster or his allies as a side-effect. There are also
several spells that take away their caster's health to restore more HP
to his allies.
