# Axes

The themes of axes focus on making yourself an attractive target to increase the
power of your attacks, and on multi-target attack and critical strikes. Abilities
revolve around trading defense for attack dice, creating critical hits and charging
in blindly, blade swinging.

## Rank One (30 cards)

Passive: Once per turn, you may roll a d6 after your attack roll. If you roll a 6,
consider all hits in that attack to be critical.

Passive: at the beginning of your turn you may opt to give all opponents a +2 bonus
when attacking you to make all of your attacks crushing (critical on 5 or 6).
