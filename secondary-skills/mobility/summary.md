# Mobility

Mobility is about moving around the battlefield, getting behind your enemies, and
returning to the safety of your allies. The passives give extra MP, and enhance your
ability to move unmolested, while the active abilities focus on getting out of the
way of attacks or getting into tactically good positions.

## Rank One

Passive: once per turn, you may move one square without provoking AO

Passive: once per turn, you may pay 1 MP to return to the square you started your turn on,
provided it is unoccupied and you are able to move.
