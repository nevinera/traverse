# Power

The themes of Power are increased damage on attacks and sacrificing defense and
mobility for stronger strikes and bigger numbers. The passive abilities focus on
increasing your attack dice in certain situations, and the activation ties largely
allow you to pay some other cost (HP, MP, cards, etc) to increase the dice on one
or more attacks.
