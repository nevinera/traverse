# Archery

The themes of archery focus on shooting things from a distance, and keeping that distance
using clever traps and tricks. The bulk of your active abilities focus on putting arrows in
things, but the rest are quite varied in their applications.

Passive: At the beginning of your turn you may give up all of your MP for a +1 bonus to your
physical attacks.

Active: once per turn, you may react to a unit moving to an adjacent square by moving one
square yourself. This triggers no AO from the instigating unit. If you do so, you start with
two less MP next turn.
