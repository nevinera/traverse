# Druidism Rank 1


Passive: any time a healing spell would enter your discard pile, roll a die. On 5-6, you may put it on the bottom of your deck instead.

Active: at the beginning of your turn you may discard one card to gain 'Cat Form' until your next turn. Playing any card will remove this form, but while in it you gain a +1 bonus to Physcal attacks, and your basic attack costs one less AP.
