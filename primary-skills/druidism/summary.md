# Druidism

The themes are healing and shapeshifting - druids are naturally support
characters, but they can be used as physical Melee in a pinch or when their
healing skills are unneeded. Their healing spells are never immediate - Druid
healing requires foresight to be effective. In animal form, they are less effective
than pure Melee roles, but their ability to switch roles smoothly allows them to be
very efficient heroes.

## Rank One (30 cards)

Active: at the beginning of your turn you may discard two cards to gain 'Bear Form'
until your next turn. Playing an card will remove this form, but while in it you gain
two physical defense dice, lose one MP each turn, and your AO may be taken as a 3pb+1
attack without using a card.

Active: at the beginning of your turn you may discard one card to gain 'Cat Form'
until your next turn. Playing any card will remove this form, but while in it you
gain a +1 bonus to physical defense, 2 MP each turn, and your basic attack costs
one less AP.
