# Druidism

The themes are healing and shapeshifting - druids are naturally support
characters, but they can be used as physical Melee in a pinch or when their
healing skills are unneeded. Their healing spells are never immediate - Druid
healing requires foresight to be effective. In animal form, they are less effective
than pure Melee roles, but their ability to switch roles smoothly allows them to be
very efficient heroes.
