## General Structure of a Dungeon

The GM has a map of the dungeon, which shows what tiles go in which location.
Before the game, the GM should retrieve all tiles to be used in this dungeon,
but they are only placed when heroes are able to see into them, which usually
entails opening a door or rounding a corner.

The dungeon manual will describe all of the important details of the dungeon,
including:

* Flavor text, description of goals
* any unusual mechanics that may apply (fog, toxic mist, etc)
* which monsters will spawn in what location (under what circumstances)
* what traps exist, and how they can be triggered
* what power cards the GM has access to, and when they can be used

## Tiles

The game includes dozens of dungeon tiles - all are rectangular, but there
are several shapes and sizes. Many contain decorative features and obstacles
or terrain of some kind, but doors can be placed anywhere on them.

A typical dungeon could consist of anywhere from six to twenty of these
tiles - dungeons can vary from short bloodbaths to rambling explorations.
Tiles are almost always connected by a closed door - the heroes cannot see
what room might be waiting until they open the door, but any monsters lurking
will certainly be activated by that event!

Each tile has a letter and number in one corner to identify it - the GM should
gather all the tiles he will need before the game starts.

## Monsters

The dungeon guide will give the locations of all of the monsters in the dungeon;
they are usually grouped together into 'encounters', to simplify activation.
Each group of monsters will be activated as soon as it becomes visible, but many
Events will also reveal or spawn some monsters.

All monsters have a round token and a card with stats and abilities - when they
take damage, indicate it by placing counters on their card. Monsters operate
in the same way as heroes, but do not have cards, instead relying on specific
abilities defined on their card. Boss monsters often have too many abilities to
fit on a card - they will still get a card, but their abilities will be listed
in the dungeon guide.

## GM cards

The GM also gets cards, which will be listed in the guide for each dungeon.
These cards always describe the circumstances in which they can be used, and
mostly can only be used once per dungeon. The GM starts each dungeon with no
cards, and draws one at the end of each turn, unless he has at least three in
his hand already.
