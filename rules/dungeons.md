## General Structure of a Dungeon

The GM has a map of the dungeon, which shows what tiles go in which location.
Before the game, the GM should retrieve all tiles to be used in this dungeon,
but they are only placed when heroes are able to see into them, which usually
entails opening a door or rounding a corner.

The dungeon manual will describe all of the important details of the dungeon,
including:

* Flavor text, description of goals
* any unusual mechanics that may apply (fog, toxic mist, etc)
* which monsters will spawn in what location (under what circumstances)
* what traps exist, and how they can be triggered
* what power cards the GM has access to, and when they can be used
