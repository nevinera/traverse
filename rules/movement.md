## Movement Points

Movement Points (MP) are used to move around the dungeon. Normally, each movement
point allows one square of movement (diagonals included), but there are situations
in which this is not the case.

### Terrain

A solid yellow or red edge on any square indicates that crossing that line *from the side the
border is on* costs an extra one or two MP. To make that clearer, if a square has a red border
all around the inside of its edge, then *leaving* that square will cost two extra MP.

Additionally, attacking across an unbalanced border gives a +1 or +2 bonus to whichever unit
would not have to pay extra to make the corresponding movement. Try to hold the 'high ground'
when you can!

## Interference

Moving across another unit has its own penalties. You cannot move onto another
unit, but you can pay *three* MP to switch places with an adjacent friendly (with
their permission). This counts as *you* moving to their spot *and* them moving to
yours for the purposes of terrain, but does not trigger any attacks of opportunity
against your ally.

Moving *from* any square adjacent to a enemy costs an extra two MP unless you allow
an "attack of opportunity" (usually abbreviated to AO). Moving when adjacent to more
than one enemy costs an extra 1 MP for each such enemy, and either all AO are triggered
or none (if adjacent to three enemies, you can't play three MP and only trigger an AO
from one of them).

If an AO is triggered, the unit performing the attack gets to play one Melee or Reach
attack from their hand immediately and for free before the movement occurs. Each unit
may only execute one AO per round (they refresh at the beginning of the unit's turn).
A unit can decline an AO if they want to hold out for another target; they don't have
to make that decision until the opportunity is presented.

## Effects

There are many effects which affect movement in one way or another, and only
the most common are described here.

- Slow: MP generated from a new turn or from spending AP is halved (round up)
- Haste: MP generated from a new turn or from spending AP is doubled
- Nimble: crossing terrain borders incurs no penalty
- Clumsy: crossing terrain borders incurs double penalty
- Immobilized: MP cannot be spent on movement
