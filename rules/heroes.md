# Skills

A Hero's capabilities are determined solely by the skills that he chooses initially
and after each dungeon. There are six primary skills and six secondary skills - you start
each campaign with two. Each skill comes with a skill card containing passive
bonuses and occasionally abilities that are permanently available, and comes with a pool
of ability cards that may be included in a hero deck. The reverse side of each skill card
contains a list of the cards in its pool, and any restrictions on their inclusion - many
of the higher skill ranks require that some number of cards from lower ranks of the skill
be included first.

The six primary skills, three ranks each of:

- Fists, quick motions and fancy footwork, building up devastating combinations
- Axes, slow and powerful, with high damage and cleaving attacks
- Archery, tricks and traps, an evasive ranged warrior
- Arcane, direct damage, deck manipulation, and countermagic
- Druidism, shapeshifting physical combat with slow and gentle healing
- Blood, life-drain and sacrifice for two-edged healing and protection

The six secondary skills, two ranks each of:

- Protection, the art of keeping monsters focused on you (and surviving)
- Power, which focuses on increasing the damage done by your spells and blows
- Insight, for finding the card you need when you need it
- Focus, which improves the odds and effects of critical strikes
- Reflexes, so you can dodge attacks and move around the battlefield
- Wisdom, to make your abilities and your deck last longer.

## Ranks

Heroes start at level one with a rank 1 primary skill and another rank 1 skill,P
for a total of 40-60 cards (all heroes must pick different starting skills). After each
dungeon is completed, every hero gains one new skill rank who's prerequisites he
satisfies. Primary skills require level 1, 3, 5 for ranks 1, 2, and 3; secondary skills
have no level requirement. Any skill rank requires all of the lower ranks in the same skill.

Two heroes *may* possess the same rank of a skill, but they will have to share the card
pool for that skill; if it cannot be managed equitably then deal half randomly to each player
to use as their card pool. A third hero may not gain the skill, as there are only two copies
of each skill card.

## Primary vs Secondary

There is nothing stopping a player from taking a second primary skill instead of a secondary
skill. The two have different purposes - primary skills are focused on actions, and have large
card pools to draw from, while secondary skills focus on strong passive bonuses and have small
pools. At ranks 1, 2, and 3 the primary skills have pools of thirty, twenty and fifteen cards;
ranks 1 and 2 of the secondaries provide ten and six respectively.

# Abilities

Each hero starts the dungeon with a deck of 40 cards in hand, most of them actions to perform.
Aside from the actions described on those cards, he has several ways to spend his AP:

- movement: you can buy movement points at a cost of 1AP for 1MP
- basic attack (3AP) 2pb melee attack
- defensive posture (2AP) gain one defense die (magical and physical) until your next turn
- discard (1AP) discard one card from your hand

There are some consumables and abilities that allow you to regain some of your used cards,
but your deck is your source of power. Try to save some cards for the boss!

Heroes initially get three MP and five AP each turn. Their basic attack is 2d6, and they have
one defense die. They have 10HP, and have a handsize of 5. They get bonuses to these numbers
as follows:

- level 2: +1 MP, +5 HP
- level 3: +1 defense die, +1 attack bonus, +10 HP
- level 4: +1 AP, +1 attack bonus, +15 HP
- level 5: +1 MP, +1 hand size, +20 HP

## Consumables

Consumable cards may be gained during play; they are frequently found in chests in the dungeon,
and may also be offered as rewards for completing side-goals and defeating bosses. Some basic
consumables are listed below, but they are varied, and many are secret until received.

Consumables may be shuffled into the heroes' decks before each dungeon - a maximum of five consumables
may be included each time. When a consumable is found during a dungeon, the hero who finds it has
the *option* to immediately shuffle it into his current deck (consumables received by the whole group
may be assigned to any hero). When a consumable is used, it immediately is returned to the GM; if it
is not used, the hero may keep it and include it again another day.

A consumable need not be used when it is played - the hero may place it in front of him during his
turn for free, and only pays its cost if and when he uses it.

- Health Potion (1AP): regain max(3d6) HP
- Swiftness Potion (1AP): immediately gain 2d6 MP
- Aqua Vitae(2AP): Shuffle ten random cards from your discard pile into your deck
- Potion of Strength (1AP): Your physical attacks get a +2 bonus, and bashing attacks roll one
  extra die. Duration 3 turns
- Scroll of Contemplation (2AP): Draw six cards, then shuffle all but four of your cards into your deck

## Equipment

Unlike other cards, these are not shuffled into your deck. They typically have passive effects or
add basic abilities, much like skill cards, and are placed in front of you during the game. You can
own any number of equipment cards, but you can only bring two pieces with you (and only one can be
a "weapon"). Equipment and artifacts can be found just like consumables, but you may select one
piece of standard equipment (marked "standard", and therefore available at the store) after each
dungeon for the whole party to share (one party member must be capable of using it to select it).
Unlike consumables, equipment may have a level or skill requirement on it.


Some examples:

- Chain Mail (req lvl 2): reduce MP recovery by 1, increase physical defense dice by one
- Wicked Axe (req axes 2): +1 bonus to all axe attacks
- Hiking Boots: you may treat red terrain as yellow.
