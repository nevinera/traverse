# Skills

A Hero's capabilities are determined solely by the skills that he chooses initially
and after each dungeon. There are six primary skills and six secondary skills - you start
each campaign with two. Each skill comes with a skill card containing passive
bonuses and occasionally abilities that are permanently available, and comes with a pool
of ability cards that may be included in a hero deck. The reverse side of each skill card
contains a list of the cards in its pool, and any restrictions on their inclusion - many
of the higher skill ranks require that some number of cards from lower ranks of the skill
be included first.

The six primary skills, three ranks each of:

- Fists, quick motions and fancy footwork, building up devastating combinations
- Axes, slow and powerful, with high damage and cleaving attacks
- Witchcraft, hexes and curses that weaken and damage their enemies slowly
- Arcane, direct damage, deck manipulation, and countermagic
- Druidism, shapeshifting physical combat with slow and gentle healing
- Blood, life-drain and sacrifice for two-edged healing and protection

The six secondary skills, two ranks each of:

- Protection, the art of keeping monsters focused on you (and surviving)
- Power, which focuses on increasing the damage done by your spells and blows
- Insight, for finding the card you need when you need it
- Focus, which improves the odds and effects of critical strikes
- Mobility, which allows you to move around the battlefield at will
- Reflexes, so you can dodge attacks and take advantage of mistakes

## Ranks

Heroes start at level one with a rank 1 primary skill and another rank 1 skill,
for a total of 40-60 cards (all heroes must pick different starting skills). After each
dungeon is completed, every hero gains one new skill rank who's prerequisites he
satisfies. Primary skills require level 1, 3, 5 for ranks 1, 2, and 3; secondary skills
have no level requirement. Any skill rank requires all of the lower ranks in the same skill.

Two heroes *may* possess the same rank of a skill, but they will have to share the card
pool for that skill; if it cannot be managed equitably then deal half randomly to each player
to use as their card pool. A third hero may not gain the skill, as there are only two copies
of each skill card.

## Primary vs Secondary

There is nothing stopping a player from taking a second primary skill instead of a secondary
skill. The two have different purposes - primary skills are focused on actions, and have large
card pools to draw from, while secondary skills focus on strong passive bonuses and have small
pools. At ranks 1, 2, and 3 the primary skills have pools of thirty, twenty and fifteen cards;
ranks 1 and 2 of the secondaries provide ten and six respectively.

# Abilities

Each hero starts the dungeon with a deck of 40 cards in hand, most of them actions to perform.
Aside from the actions described on those cards, he has several ways to spend his AP:

- movement: you can buy movement points at a cost of 1AP for 2MP
- basic attack (3AP) 2d6 melee attack
- defensive posture (2AP) gain one defense die until your next turn
- discard (1AP) discard one card from your hand

There are some consumables that allow you to regain some of your used cards, and Fists
has a built-in ability to that effect, but your deck is your source of power. Try to
save some cards for the boss!
