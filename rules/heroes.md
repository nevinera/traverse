## Skills

A Hero's capabilities are determined solely by the skills that he chooses initially
and after each dungeon. There are six primary skills and six secondary skills - you start
each campaign with one of each.

The six primary skills:

- Fists, quick motions and fancy footwork, building up devastating combinations
- Axes, slow and powerful, with high damage and cleaving attacks
- Witchcraft, hexes and curses that weaken and damage their enemies slowly
- Arcane, direct damage, deck manipulation, and countermagic
- Druidism, shapeshifting physical combat with slow and gentle healing
- Blood, life-drain and sacrifice for two-edged healing and protection

The six secondary skills:

- Protection, the art of keeping monsters focused on you (and surviving)
- Power, which focuses on increasing the damage done by your spells and blows
- Insight, for finding the card you need when you need it
- Focus, which improves the odds and effects of critical strikes
- Mobility, which allows you to move around the battlefield at will
- Reflexes, so you can dodge attacks and take advantage of mistakes
