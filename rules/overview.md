## Players

Traverse can handle two to 4 players. One player, called the GM, controls the
dungeon and monsters. He has access to the Dungeon Guide for the current
campaign, and builds the dungeon as players reveal new areas, placing monsters
when appropriate. The other 1-3 players are called 'Heroes', and their goal is
generally to traverse the dungeon, defeat the boss, rescue the princess, etc.

## Components

The Basic game consists of:

* Rulebook
* Dungeon Guide for 'Goblin Keep'
* Dungeon Tiles, 1-inch gridded
* GM power cards
* 6 Major Skill Sets, with four levels each
* 6 Minor Skill Sets, with three levels each
* 6 Figurines for Heroes
* Many 1-inch cardboard punch-outs for monsters (some 2-inch as well)
* Many GM monster cards (one per token) containing stats and powers
* 15 standing Door markers
* 12 six-sided dice of various colors

## Pre-Game

Each 'game' of Traverse consists of invading one level of a campaign and attempting
to accomplish its stated goals. For the Heroes, this usually entails
retrieving/killing/rescuing/destroying/eradicating something specific. For the
Game Master, most often the goal is to kill the heroes, but sometimes he has
extra objectives that would count as a victory (The Heroes will always be told
of these extra objectives).

The GM will read any initial text, which should specify goals, unusual mechanics,
and some flavor text. Then the Heroes and GM all construct the deck with
which they will play the dungeon. The GMs deck is specified by the guide
for that dungeon level, but the Heroes can use any cards from pools they
have access to (though some skills specify requirements in order to include
cards from their pools). For levels 1-5, hero decks contain exactly forty cards;
higher level dungeons may require larger decks later on.

The GM will set up the initial room of the dungeon, the heroes will be
placed inside, and play commences.

## Anatomy of a Round

Every Round has three phases:

* Beginning
  * All units refill their Action Points and Movement Points
  * All Heroes draw back up to five cards in hand
  * Periodic effects happen ("Each Turn")
  * Unconcious Heroes lose one health (if they reach -10, they die)

* Heroes and Monsters take their turns, in initiative order
  * Initiative ties are broken in favor of Heroes.
  * Any Hero may choose to delay their turn until another Hero takes theirs.

* Ending
  * Temporary effects lose one token (if they have no tokens left, they end)
  * Heroes may discard up to two cards if they choose.

A 'turn' consists of spending AP and MP as desired.

Movement Points allow you to move a space in any direction (including diagonally,
but not across corners). Some spaces require more than one Movement Point, and
some effects increase the cost of movement - one cannot move part of a square.

Action Points allow you to do many things, which are described fully in the
heroes file.
